This extension only works with https://www.lotteryleaf.com/bc/bc-49/*
I have no affiliation, it was just the first link I clicked where the numbers were displayed by year.

This requires a lot of user input, for a more automatic approach use the C# Application/Library.

How To Use:

(Install)
-Open Google Chrome
-Open the Extensions Tab chrome://extensions/
-Turn on Developer Mode
-Load Unpacked and select this folder.

(Extracting Numbers)
-Go to lotteryleaf.com
-Navigate to the BC49 numbers and select a year.

-Click the Export button in the top right corner.
or
-Check Auto Export, and refresh the page.
-With Auto Export checked, every year you visit will automatically save a CSV file.

-Once you have all the years, click the Combine button
-Select all the exported csv files, and hit ok. It will combine them all into one file and export.
